Question 1: 

Take 7 and divide it by every number less than it that is greater than 1

If 7 divided by all the numbers between 7 and 1 have remainders, 7 is prime

If 7 divided by any number between 7 and 1 doesnt have a remainder, 7 is not prime



Question 2

Take Number and divide it by every number less than it that is greater than 1

If Number divided by all the numbers between Number and 1 have remainders, Number is prime

If Number divided by any number between Number and 1 doesnt have a remainder, Number is not prime 
     


Question 3

Check the first and last letter to see if they match

Continue with the second letter and second to last letter

Continue this for the length of the word

If all letters match the letters on the opposite side of the list:
   
	The word is a palindrome

Else:
   
	The word is not a palindrome



Question 4

Take the top two card from the stack

Compare the two cards and decide which one has the higher number

Keep the highest number card and place the lower number card into a dicard stack

Continue taking the top card from the stack and compare it with the high number card

If the newly drawn card is higher than the high card keep new card as new high card and discard the old high card

Else discard new card and keep same high card

Continue this until all cards have been drawn from the stack. 

The last highest card you have left should be the highest number card in the deck



Question 5

Input a Number

Subtract 1 from the Number and make that new Number

Multiply Number times (Number + 1) and make it equal Factorial

Make new Number equal (Number - 1)

While Number is greater than 0:
      
	Factorial equal old Factorial times Number
      
	Then new Number equals (Number - 1)

Once the while loop ends Factorial is the factorial of the number you input
